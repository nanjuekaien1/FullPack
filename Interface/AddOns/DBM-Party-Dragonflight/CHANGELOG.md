[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Dungeons/compare/r68...r69) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Dungeons/releases)

- hate when I do that. I forgot to change to count object  
- improve/fix language for the icon options  
- Add count to screech timer and reset count when either goal are activated. Count will be shown in alerts and timers  
- fix option key of last and default key  
- Odyn now has a drop down with 4 configurations available for runic Brand. This allows you to choose any of the 4 following options  
       - "Gives voice alerts give icon based directions (such as using flares)",  
       - "Gives voice alerts based on cardinal directions as if entrance is south and throne is north",  
       - "Gives voice alerts based on cardinal directions based on minimap, where throne is south and entrance is north",  
       - "Gives generic voice alert that just says you're targeted. No direction indication is given"--Default  
- remove all directions from DBM  
- Re-fix ragnarok timer, which got broken since the commit it was fixed in was reverted cause other stuff in it was bad.  
- another tweak but at this point my hands are kind of up in air with inhale timer. i'm convinced it's just math.random
