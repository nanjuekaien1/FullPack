    Also updated a few of the locales to use the DBM locale.  
- Revert "LoadPlugin example"  
- LoadPlugin example  
- use the loop for the nag  
- whitespace improvement and added some more common locals

- Fixees (#213)  
    * Fixees  
    * Better way of doing it  
- adjust bubbling overflow scheduling by 2 seconds based on twitch stream
