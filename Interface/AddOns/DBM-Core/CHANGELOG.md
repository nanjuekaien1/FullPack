# Deadly Boss Mods Core

## [8.3.10](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/tree/8.3.10) (2020-02-04)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/compare/8.3.9...8.3.10)

- Prep new Release  
- Code refactoring and updates to non mythic difficulties of Nzoth  
- Release Mythic Carapace mod along with some non mythic improvements as well  
- Make hudar a fixed size outside, in the one place no one would EVER use it because regular radar works outside. one day, maybe this can be rewritten to actually work indoors so people don't have to disable text range finder and download weak auras for every boss instead.  
- Cleaned up unused commented code from all Nyalotha mods  
    Added count to fixate timer on Shadhar  
    Fixed GTFO on Shadhar so it'll work now.  
    Added optional OFF by default fixate special warning to Hivemind  
    Added GTFO for acid pools on Hivemind  
- Fix last build failure  
- More local updates  
- Adjusted spam throttle rate of brutal smash on vexiona from 4 second ICD to 3 second.  
    Made ground GTFO warning also trigger faster on Vexiona  
- Blizz made it annoyingly difficult to track stacks on mythic wrathion, so use infoframe to do it instead and remove special warnings for now

- Submit local update for translation  
- Push several bugfixes and code refactors to Nzoth corruptor for NON mythic. Didn't want users who are not mythic raiders not getting best mods available to them so bugs found in making mythic updates go out asap.
