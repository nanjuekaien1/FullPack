- And fix that  
- Prevent nil errors trying to access timer tables that don't exist, that should resolve tons of lua errors in last update on sylvanas  
    Also fixed bug where tank warning was spammy on sylvanas.  
    These two fixes merited redoing last release.  
- missed tweaking these, nothing major though.  
- prep next dev cycle
