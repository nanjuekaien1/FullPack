    Fixed a bug where first inversion timer didn't show on normal Sivara
    Tweaked some start timers on behemoth after verifying them in all 4 difficulties.
    Fixed bug on Radiance where the tide fist timer never started on any difficulty do to a spell ID swap.
    Simplified timer tables after verifying all 4 difficulties use exact same timers.

    Added fading countdown yells to Piercing Barb
    Improved Ashvane timer handling so it better supports the major differences between normal's timers, and the timers heroic/mythic use.
    Re-Added the rippling wave special warning but made it off by default. Wave handlers now has a warning they can enable and customize as needed.
    No longer stop add timers after 3 casts On phase 1 Orgozoa, since now it's possible to get more than 3 add sets.

    Add auto range checker to Behemoth on all difficulties
    Added mythic icon to Barb timer on Behemoth
    Updated timer for First Chimeric Marks on mythic Sivara
    Possible fix to azshara decree special warnings only ever showing first passed objective instead of all of them (didn't affect yells, which corrected detected them all)
    Changed timer start event for Stormwraths to be more accurate, but disabled arcane bomb start timer since it's affected by spell lockout and I don't want to hard code every spell lockout into an ability it'll use right away once spell lockout ends.
    Also applied experimental timer fade stuff to gale buffet timers on mythic based on which stormwrath you are near.

    Added switch warnings for big adds in phase 1 and 2 for dps. The phase 2 warnings won't work on normal or LFR though since they use an event that only exists in heroic+
    Fixed up heroic timers on phase changes for abilities who's timers do NOT match normal mode.
    Fixed a bug where reversal timer was started in Phase 2 normal and not heroic. logic was reversed.
    Fixed Heroic arcane detonation timer, it's faster than normal by 5 seconds.
    Added Preliminary P3 beckon timer for second beckon cast of phase. needs a LOT more data since it only knows first two casts on heroic and only 1 cast on non heroic.
    Moved P4 trigger to an earlier trigger, but left old one in case new one is a little too soon. Added some debug lines so advanced users can pay attention to whether or not the earlier P4 trigger has issues or not.
