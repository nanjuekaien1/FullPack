# <DBM> World Bosses (Shadowlands)

## [9.2.9](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/tree/9.2.9) (2022-03-24)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/9.2.8...9.2.9) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- prep new tag for retail  
- Lords of Dread Update  
     - Tweaks to lords of dread for more accurate timers on all difficulties. Mythic timers are actually same as heroic and other modes. They were also just data needed to finally figure out missing pieces to some of the pause/resume functionality of fight. :D  
     - While at it, also added helper for biting wounds  
     - Fixed Kin'tessa's creature Id so boss health reporting will work better now (and her timers canceling upon her death)  
- Release mythhic rygelon mod  
- refactor taunt logic on skolex to maybe work better  
- bump alphas
