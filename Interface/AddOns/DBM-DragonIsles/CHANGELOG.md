## [10.0.13](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/tree/10.0.13) (2022-12-27)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/10.0.12...10.0.13) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- prep new retail tag  
- Fix typo.  closes #https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/issues/845  
- Fix IT localization (#171) To avoid confusion while quickly reading some warnings during fights, the warning to interrupt an enemy cast/channel is no longer using the exact same keyword as the warning to stop casting/channeling our spells or the warning to stop attacking, but instead uses a different wording with a way less ambiguos meaning and no common terms with other warnings about completely different stuff. The rest are minor changes to increase clarity and typos being fixed.  
- Fixed a bug where hunters would get spammed interrupt warnings due to missing spell in cooldown check  
- bump alpha
