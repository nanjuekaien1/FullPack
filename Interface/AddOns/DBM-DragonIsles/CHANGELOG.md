# <DBM> World Bosses (Dragonflight)

## [10.1.15](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/tree/10.1.15) (2023-07-12)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/10.1.14...10.1.15) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- prep new tag with achievement lua error fix for retail. Making mandatory update since that error breaks startcombat functions from running, which effectively breaks every boss mod there is, so can't let users linger on a broken version. It's a major patch, users should expect that with api breakage, new updates are forced  
- Piss off luacheck  
- bump alphas
