# BagSync

## [v17.6](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/tree/v17.6) (2022-11-22)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/compare/v17.5...v17.6) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/releases)

- Fixed an issue where the Auction scanning was not properly parsing expired Timers for certain items.  
    Fixed the expired Auctions function of BagSync to properly remove items that have expired from the Auction House.  
- Added a new option to allow users to select if they prefer more accurate Battle Pets in the Guild Bank and Mailbox.  (With a warning that it may cause lag).  
    Added a new entry to the BagSync FAQ section explaining the new option and it's potential to cause lag.  
    Set this option to be enabled by default as it only really affects users with a lot of Battle Pets in the Guild Bank.  
    Moved the Guild Bank tooltip option to the Storage section instead in the configs.
