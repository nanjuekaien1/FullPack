[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/compare/v18.21...v18.22) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/releases)

-   
    * Fixed an issue where BattlePets were not properly being shown in the BagSync Search window.  (Fixes #263)  
    * Updated FixDB to automatically update all old BattlePet entries into the new format.  (Fixes #263)  
    * Removed External Tooltip support for the Sorted addon as it was redundant to display with the BagSync item counts.  
    * Fixed a bug that was displaying Expansion and ItemType information on BattlePets.  This information is not provided by Blizzard so it's not possible to display for BattlePets.  
    * Fixed an issue where the External Tooltip for BagSync was flashing on the AuctionUI.  (Fixes #259)  
-   
    * Updated License for LibItemScout as I want that to be public for everyone to use and edit as they see fit for their addons.
