- New vs Old Addon Settings Panel  
    * Fixed an issue where there was conflicts with blizzards new addons settings panel vs the older one.  In some situations it would generate an error because the older settings panel is being depreciated.  BagSync will now properly compensate for this and display the config screen based on which is being used. (Fixes #308)

    * Updated the License to reflect the additional libraries.  
    * Added more information to the Help Window for the new battlepet and petcage qualifiers.
