-   
    * Added an option to display or disable showing Guild item counts separately from the character totals.  This was enabled by default but I added an option to disable this.  
-   
    * Small fix for displaying guilds separately.  
-   
    * Temporary fix AGAIN for the issues with BAG\_UPDATE\_DELAYED event on the Blizzard servers.  It seems the recent hotfix broke it.... yet again.  (Fixes #245)
