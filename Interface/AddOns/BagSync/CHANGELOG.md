[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/compare/v17.7...v17.8) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/releases)

- Major Debugging changes to BagSync across the board.  This will make things easier for me to track problems.  
    Some code cleanup on several modules and wireframes.  
    Updated localizations thanks to wonderful contributors.  You guys are awesome!  
    I will be adding more Debug stuff as I go along.  This is mostly for me and unless you are REALLY interested in seeing BagSync debug, you will need tekDebug (https://github.com/Xruptor/tekdebug) then enable BSYC.debugTrace.
