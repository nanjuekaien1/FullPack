- Fixed an issue where the currency totals were not showing up properly in the tooltip.  Fixes #161  
    Fixed an issue where a patch changed the way Currency is scanned by BagSync.  Currencies should now properly be scanned and stored.  
    Added a new Debug option to show some Debug Info to help with solving Tooltip issues from users.  
    Added CurrencyID to the ItemID display option in the BagSync Config.  
    Special thanks to rubenjurado from GitHub, with their help I was able to resolve the currency issue.
