- Guild Bank Money Fix & Color Reset  
    * Fixed an issue where the Guild Bank Money value was being set to zero upon login due to a restriction by Blizzard.  This restriction automatically returns a zero money value when not at a guild bank.  (Fixes #314)  
    * Fixed an issue where resetting the colors was not also resetting the global values.
