        Gold Window and Saved Search Updates  
        * Added a new option to display Silver and Copper as part of the Gold Window totals.  (Fixes #297)  
        * Fixed an issue where the saved search items were overlapping and obscuring other entries in the list view.  In addition I added a tooltip to display the total item value.  (Fixes #296)  
        * Reverted a change to the Details window.  It will now show ALL characters across all servers regardless of settings.  It is a "Details" window after all and should show EVERYTHING.
