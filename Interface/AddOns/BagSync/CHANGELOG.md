    * Updated the license for BagSync due to some issues that have arisen.  
-   
    * Reverted back to an older LibItemSearch that was made by Tuller years ago.  I originally used it and at one point when work was stopped on it, renamed it to LibItemSearchGrid back in v11.0 of BagSync.  I have reverted back to this version and updated it to make things a bit more simplified for me and allow me to manage the code myself.  So I have renamed it to LibItemScout to prevent confusion with LibItemSearch of any future iterations.  
    * Added a new option to display the source expansion for items in the tooltip.  Note that this only works on Retail servers and not on classic.  Not all items will display their expansion as Blizzard did not update every item to return the expansionID associated with it.
