    Fixes #21: Instead of initializing all non-existing keywords to 0, only keywords which are really valid are initialized. This resolves a bug where all groups would match a filter expression when an invalid keywords was used as a boolean value. Because the non-existing keyword was initialized to 0, the filter would return 0 in some cases which evaluates to true in LUA. This fix also re-enables semantic error messages which were previously suppressed because all possible variables were existing.
